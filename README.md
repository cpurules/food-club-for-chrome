# Food Club Better for Chrome
This is a simple Chrome extension that is meant to speed up the process of placing Food Club bets on Neopets.

The extension adds "Place Bet" buttons next to the bet descriptions on several bettor pet pages.  Clicking on the button will set a cookie for that bet, and open the Food Club betting page.  When the betting page is opened, if the bet cookie is found, the extension will automatically populate the details of that bet.

Current supported pet pages:
* [boochi_target](http://www.neopets.com/~boochi_target)
* [HGB](http://www.neopets.com/~HGB)
